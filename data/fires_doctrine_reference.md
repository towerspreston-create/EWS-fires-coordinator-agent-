# MAGTF Fires Doctrine Quick Reference

## Section 1: D3A Targeting Methodology

The **Decide, Detect, Deliver, and Assess (D3A)** methodology is a four-function tactical targeting process used by Army and Marine Corps forces from division through battalion. It synchronizes maneuver, information, intelligence, and fires to create desired effects at the right time and place.

### DECIDE
**Purpose:** Translate commander's intent into targeting priorities and engagement guidance.

**Key Actions:**
- Analyze commander's guidance and operational environment
- Develop High-Payoff Target List (HPTL) from High-Value Targets (HVTs)
- Establish Target Selection Standards (TSS)
- Create Attack Guidance Matrix (AGM)
- Determine when, where, and how to engage targets

**Primary Outputs:** HPTL, TSS, AGM, Targeting Synchronization Matrix (TSM)

### DETECT
**Purpose:** Locate and identify targets meeting engagement criteria.

**Key Actions:**
- Execute information collection plan against HPTs
- Task acquisition assets (radars, UAS, observers, ISR)
- Validate target accuracy and timeliness against TSS
- Confirm target location error (TLE) meets weapon system requirements
- Track moving targets and confirm stationary target positions

**Primary Outputs:** Confirmed target locations, updated target status, collection reports

### DELIVER
**Purpose:** Engage targets with appropriate capabilities to create desired effects.

**Key Actions:**
- Match weapon systems to targets based on range, effect, and availability
- Execute fire missions and coordinate airspace
- Deconflict fires with maneuver and other supporting arms
- Employ lethal and nonlethal capabilities per AGM guidance
- Coordinate quick-fire and counterfire procedures

**Primary Outputs:** Executed engagements, fire mission reports, ammunition expenditure data

### ASSESS
**Purpose:** Evaluate engagement effects and determine need for re-attack.

**Key Actions:**
- Conduct Battle Damage Assessment (BDA)
- Perform Munitions Effectiveness Assessment (MEA)
- Determine if desired effects achieved
- Recommend re-attack or target adjustment
- Update targeting products based on assessment

**Primary Outputs:** BDA reports, re-attack recommendations, updated HPTL/AGM

## Section 2: Joint Targeting Cycle

The **Joint Targeting Cycle** is a six-phase iterative process for deliberate targeting at operational and strategic levels.

| Phase | Description | Fires Relevance |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **1. Commander's Objectives, Guidance & Intent** | Establishes targeting priorities and desired effects | Foundational—drives all targeting decisions |
| **2. Target Development & Prioritization** | Identifies, validates, and prioritizes targets | Critical—develops HPTL and joint target lists |
| **3. Capabilities Analysis** | Matches capabilities to targets; weaponeering | Essential—determines weapon-target pairing |
| **4. Commander's Decision & Force Assignment** | Approves targets and assigns forces | Key approval gate for fires employment |
| **5. Mission Planning & Force Execution** | Plans and executes engagements | Primary execution phase for fires |
| **6. Combat Assessment** | Assesses effects and recommends re-attack | Closes loop; informs future targeting |

**Note:** D3A maps to Joint Targeting Cycle: Decide = Phases 1-2; Detect/Deliver = Phases 3-5; Assess = Phase 6.

## Section 3: Fire Support Coordination Measures (FSCMs)

| Measure | Abbr | Definition | Establishes | Key Planning Consideration |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Coordinated Fire Line** | CFL | Line beyond which surface fires may engage without coordination with ground commander | Brigade/Division | Place close to FLOT; does not eliminate airspace coordination requirement |
| **Fire Support Coordination Line** | FSCL | Line beyond which fires require coordination with affected commanders; short of line requires establishing commander coordination | Land/Amphibious Force Cdr | Place on identifiable terrain; all components coordinate across it |
| **Restrictive Fire Area** | RFA | Area with specific restrictions; fires exceeding restrictions require coordination | Battalion or higher | Specify restrictions (munition type, time, etc.) |
| **No-Fire Area** | NFA | Area where fires prohibited except: (1) establishing HQ approves or (2) force protection emergency | Any echelon | Only two exceptions; most restrictive measure |
| **Free-Fire Area** | FFA | Area where any weapon may fire without additional coordination | Division or higher | Still must comply with ROE and LOAC |
| **Airspace Coordination Area** | ACA | Block of airspace for aircraft safety from surface fires | Airspace Control Authority | Define min/max altitude, baseline, effective times |

**Permissive measures** (CFL, FSCL, FFA, Kill Box) facilitate fires; **Restrictive measures** (NFA, RFA, RFL, ACA) protect friendly forces.

## Section 4: MAGTF Fires Integration

### Key Organizations

**Fires and Effects Coordination Center (FECC):** Senior MAGTF fire support organization in the Command Element. Directs targeting, coordinates counterfire, integrates fires with GCE, ACE, and external agencies.

**Fire Support Coordination Center (FSCC):** Exists at Division, Regiment, and Battalion. Centralizes communications and personnel for coordinating all fire support for the GCE. Includes air section, NGLO section, and artillery section.

**Marine TACC:** Senior Marine air command and control agency. Coordinates aviation fires through deep battle cell (interdiction) and close battle cell (CAS).

### Supporting Arms Coordination

**Air Support:** Coordinated through Marine TACC and DASC. CAS requires terminal attack control; interdiction coordinated via deep battle cell. Integrate into ATO cycle.

**Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS):** Coordinated through SACC (afloat) or FSCC. Consider gun-target line for dispersion patterns. Ships assigned DS or GS missions to supported units.

**Ground Fires (Artillery/HIMARS):** Coordinated through FAHQ and FSCC. HIMARS requires airspace coordination due to trajectory. Integrate into counterfire and deep fires planning.

### Deep vs. Close Fires

**Deep Fires:** Shape the battlespace ahead of ground maneuver. Primarily ACE and long-range surface fires (HIMARS). Coordinated through FECC and Marine TACC deep battle cell. Focus on interdiction, counterfire, and shaping.

**Close Fires:** Direct support to engaged ground forces. Artillery, mortars, CAS, and NSFS. Coordinated through FSCC and DASC. Requires detailed integration with scheme of maneuver.

### MAGTF Operations Afloat Considerations
- SACC controls fires while afloat; transitions to FECC/FSCC ashore
- Coordinate NSFS early; ships require time to position
- Plan passage of fire support control during ship-to-shore movement
- Integrate with CATF fire support plan during amphibious phases

## Section 5: Target Development

### Target Categories

| Category | Definition | Engagement |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Planned** | Pre-identified targets with scheduled engagement times | Engage per timeline; confirm before firing |
| **Immediate** | Highest priority; engage immediately, even diverting assets | Take precedence over all except TSTs |
| **On-Call** | Pre-planned targets engaged when trigger conditions met | Engage when trigger criteria satisfied |
| **As Acquired** | Engage as detected per HPTL priority | Attack in priority order when multiple detected |

### High-Payoff Target List (HPTL)

**Purpose:** Prioritized list of targets whose loss significantly contributes to friendly mission success.

**Development:**
- Derived from HVT list through wargaming
- Prioritized by phase of operation
- Linked to commander's objectives and scheme of maneuver
- Updated based on assessment and changing conditions

### Target Selection Standards (TSS)

**Purpose:** Criteria for determining when battlefield information becomes an actionable target.

**Components:**
- **Timeliness:** How current must target info be (e.g., 15 min for mobile targets)
- **Accuracy:** Required target location error (e.g., 100m for precision munitions)
- **Size:** Element size for engagement (point vs. area target)

### Attack Guidance Matrix (AGM)

**Purpose:** Commander-approved guidance on how and when to engage HPTs.

**Elements:**
- HPT (prioritized by phase)
- WHEN: Planned (P), As Acquired (A), or Immediate (I)
- HOW: Weapon system/capability
- EFFECT: Desired outcome (destroy, neutralize, suppress)
- REMARKS: BDA requirements, coordination, restrictions

## Section 6: Battle Damage Assessment (BDA)

### Three Levels of BDA

| Level | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Physical Damage Assessment | Quantitative estimate of physical damage from blast, fragmentation, fire. Based on observed/interpreted damage. |
| **Phase 2** | Functional Damage Assessment | Estimate of target's remaining capability to perform mission. Includes time to reconstitute. All-source analysis. |
| **Phase 3** | Target System Assessment | Broad assessment of overall impact on entire target system capability (e.g., enemy IADS). Conducted at higher echelons. |

### Re-Attack Recommendation Criteria

Consider re-attack when:
- Desired effects not achieved per AGM
- Target retains significant operational capability
- Target priority remains high on HPTL
- Assets available without compromising other missions
- BDA indicates partial damage requiring completion

### BDA Reporting Essentials
- Report quickly—Phase 1 BDA often from strike aircraft or observers
- Include: Target ID, weapon employed, observed effects, time of engagement
- Distinguish confirmed damage from estimated damage
- Feed results into targeting cycle for HPTL/AGM updates

| **Engagement Criteria** | Standards that must be met before target engagement (TSS, positive ID, weapon-target match) |
| **Counterfire** | Fires to destroy or neutralize enemy indirect fire weapons (rockets, artillery, mortars) |
| **Suppression** | Fires degrading target performance below mission-capable level during fires delivery |
| **Neutralization** | Rendering target temporarily ineffective (approx. 10% casualties for personnel targets) |
| **Destruction** | Rendering target permanently combat-ineffective (approx. 30% casualties for personnel targets) |
| **Target Location Error (TLE)** | Difference between reported coordinates and actual target location |
| **Weaponeering** | Process of determining quantity and type of weapons to achieve desired effect |
| **Quick-Fire Channel** | Pre-coordinated communication link for expedited fire mission processing |
| **Call for Fire Zone (CFFZ)** | Zone where targets meeting criteria automatically trigger counterfire |
